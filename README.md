## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Rather than copying a template, or using a pre-made portfolio page, I opted to be a bit more creative and execute a unique design. This portfolio will continue to grow with me as I continue to develop. Keep popping back in to check out the changes.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for the link to the live application.

### Prerequisites
Before doing anything remember to install all the dependencies using

```
npm install
```

### Running Application
This is a pretty simple application to run just use

```
npm run start
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
